**Our Philosophy**

We believe that our thoughts and actions are the very source
of our current conditions. Any change that we wish to bring about in our
family, friends, workplace, community -- can happen only when we change from
within. The _i_ in our
Awaken i project, represents this great source of power within every
individual, the hidden potential that each of us bring and the chance that each
of us deserve - to innovate, create, take initiative and inspire people around
us. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fe367de-3ddd-421d-991d-3aafa0204d2a.png)
